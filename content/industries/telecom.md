## Telecom's an Industry Undergoing Constant Rapid Change
 

##  Broadcasting Group Case Study

## The Problem
In 2012, a British Broadcasting Group were expanding to new markets. The organisation needed a rapid solution to integrate 
a new market with minimal impact to their existing infrastructure. They selected Salesforce and Force.com and used Mule ESB and the Mule 
Salesforce connector to provide a hybrid-cloud solution that could be built and deployed rapidly thanks to Mule’s strong  XML 
and integration capabilities that helped make this rapid solution possible.

## Our Solution
Ricston consultants were brought in to analyse the requirement and propose a solution using best 
practices and kick off the project with a running start. Mule’s out-of-the-box Salesforce connector was utilised, allowing the 
client's team to avoid having to build custom code and focus instead on configuration without the need to re-create interfaces.

Ricston helped overcome limitations of Salesforce when the business required to receive push notifications. Ricston’s PushTopic 
solution allowed Mule flow to ‘listen’ to any changes being made to the Salesforce table. Pushtopic is an extension of 
Salesforce which notifies listeners of any changes in records.
